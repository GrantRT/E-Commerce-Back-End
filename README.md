# E-Commerce-Back-End

## Introduction

The task was to build the back end for an e-commerce site by modifying starter code. I configured a working Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

## Technology Used

- Javascript
- Node.js
- MySQL
- Sequelize
- Express.js

## Instructions

Firstly make sure all dependencies are installed by typing `npm i` in the console.

Then enter `source db/schema.sql` into the MySQL shell.

Then return to the console and type `npm run seed` to seed the example data into the database.

Finally to start the server, type `npm start` into the console.

This all shown in the video demonstration below.
